 **Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning**

📌 **Project Overview**

This project focuses on building an end-to-end machine learning regression pipeline to predict used car prices based on vehicle attributes such as age, mileage, fuel type, engine power, and brand. Multiple regression models were evaluated, and the best-performing model was selected for deployment.
The final solution includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and inference-ready artifacts.

**Objective**

Predict the market price of used cars
Compare multiple regression algorithms
Select a high-performing, generalizable model
Save trained components for real-world inference

**Models Evaluated**
The following regression models were trained and evaluated:
Linear Regression
Ridge Regression
Lasso Regression
Decision Tree Regressor
Random Forest Regressor
Gradient Boosting Regressor (Final Model)

**Model Performance**
The Histogram Gradient Boosting Regressor delivered the best overall performance:
R² Score: 0.92
RMSE: 70,830
This model demonstrated a strong balance between accuracy and generalization, making it suitable for deployment.
